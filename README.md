## Overview of the analysis:

The objective of the analysis is to create a dataframe using the data provided for cities and rides. The two data sources were merged to determine statistics such as total rides by city type, fare per ride, average fare per driver and average fare per ride. This new data frame was then converted into a line chart to view the performance by city type for the months of Jan - May 2019.

## Results:
- Urban rides topped the list in terms of total rides and drivers but the average fare per ride and average fare per rider was the lowest among the three city types. 
- Rural rides topped the list in terms of average fare per ride and average fare per driver but had the lowest number of total rides.
- The majority of the fares were from the urban cities followed by sub-urban.

## Summary:
- Urban rides are the biggest driver of overall revenue and we should continue investing in this space. 
- Rural areas had the lowest number of rides but it's worth investing further here since the average fare per ride is much higher than urban rides. The drivers in rural areas also have a higher average fare per ride. 
- Feb and March made the most amount of revenue across all three categories of cities during this time.
